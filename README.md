# Mobile-Development

The MD (Mobile Development) division in the "Usahayuk" project is responsible for creating a functional Android app using Kotlin and designing the UI/UX. The division focuses on developing an engaging user interface using design tools like Figma, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. The Android app is developed using Android Studio, leveraging the power of Kotlin along with various libraries and frameworks. The app consists of four main menus, namely Home, Community, Consultation, and Profile. The Home section offers three primary features: Recommendation Idea Business, Community engagement, and Consultation with Mentors.

## USER EXPERIENCE

To ensure that users have the best experience while using our app, we designed the user flow and the use case. Additionally, our system design includes four main menus: Home, Community, Consultation, and Profile. We carefully crafted the user flow to provide intuitive navigation and seamless interactions within these menus, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience for our users.

We have designed a user flow to ensure a seamless experience for our app users. The user flow diagram visually represents the logical progression of actions and interactions within the app's interface. It illustrates the different screens, navigation paths, and interactions that users will encounter while using the app. The user flow helps us identify potential bottlenecks, optimize the user journey, and deliver a smooth and efficient user experience.

## USER INTERFACE
For this part, most of the work was done in [Figma][figma-link], so please refer to the link for more details. Here, we will provide a brief overview of the design process. Initially, we created high-fidelity designs for the homepage, community page, consultation page, profile page. Below, you can view the designs.
